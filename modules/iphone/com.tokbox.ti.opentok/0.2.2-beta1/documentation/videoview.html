<h1>VideoView</h1>
<p>VideoViews are simply subtypes of 'Ti.UI.View' that have the same properties, methods, and events.
They are constructed from either the <a href="publisher.md#createview_props_">Publisher.createView(<em>props</em>)</a> or the
<a href="subscriber.md#createview_props_">Subscriber.createView(<em>props</em>)</a> method.</p>
